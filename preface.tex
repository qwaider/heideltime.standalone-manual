\section{Preface}\label{sec:Preface}
This document contains information about how to install and use the standalone version of HeidelTime. HeidelTime itself is a multilingual temporal tagger for the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions from documents, developed at the University of Heidelberg from Str\"otgen and Gertz~\cite{StroetgenGertz2010_SemEval, HeidelTime, StroetgenGertz2013_LRE}\\
The original version of HeidelTime is designed to run within a proper UIMA-Pipeline~\cite{UIMA}. With this standalone version the original version is wrapped such that it can be run with fewer prerequisites and especially without UIMA.
